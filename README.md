# BB8-CAD-2020
During my covid year of 2020 I was limited to only the CAD side of projects, so I decided to better learn solidworks and attempt to fully CAD a theoretically working BB-8 Droid from starwars. 
This was my first exposure to the concept of using 3d printed parts, so I tried to challenge myself to create more complex parts that would not need to be machined out of metal.
The design utilized a T-axis pendelum mechanism that reuquired a spinning weight at the bottom of the device to center itself inorder to allow the tilting crossbar that drove the entire vehicle to turn, this meant it had a larger turning radius but was much smoother when driving.
